this respiratory contains the guide of how to use openGL on macOS 13 or later.

### To do this, we first need to install homebrew. (it's safe)
first of all go to homebrew's official page and install it by using terminal. for convinience, straight away use the official instaling command given below 👇🏻.
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

(copy paste the full line)
refer to the guide that is showing on terminal to succesfully install it.
### install GLFW
clean up the terminal after homebrew instalisation by typing ```cls```.
now type ```brew install glfw``` and follow the guide. 
### install GLAD
now we need to add a openGL pointer functions manager. we gonna use GLAD package. 
go to this link - ```https://glad.dav1d.de```
set the following thing on the website-
>language - c/c++
>
>Specification - OpenGL
>
>profile - core

in the API section set ```gl``` to the latest version, for me it's 4.6 now.
